# Guide for Processing Grade 2 Acronyms

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for processing the 17,639 Grade 2 acronyms that need definitions, descriptions, and tags. I've provided 10 sample processed acronyms as examples of the correct format for your import file.

## Recommended Approach

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Since there are 17,639 acronyms to process, consider breaking them into manageable batches of 100-500 acronyms.

2. **Research Sources**: Use reliable sources to research the accurate meanings of acronyms:
   - Professional organization websites
   - Academic databases
   - Industry publications
   - Government websites
   - Specialized acronym dictionaries

3. **Prioritize**: Start with the most common or widely used acronyms in each batch.

4. **Field Guidelines**: Follow these guidelines for each field:

   - **Definition**: The full expanded form of the acronym
   - **Description**: A 1-3 sentence explanation of what the acronym represents, its purpose, and its significance
   - **Tags**: 3-5 relevant keywords that categorize the acronym (e.g., Medical, Technology, Education)
   - **Slug**: Format as `lowercase-acronym/lowercase-hyphenated-definition`
   - **Status**: Set as "Approved" for all entries
   - **Price (USD)**: Set as "$0" for all entries
   - **Grade**: Keep as "2" for all entries
   - **Custom Pricing**: Set as "No" for all entries
   - **Suggested Category**: Add a single primary category that best represents the acronym

5. **CSV Format**: Ensure your CSV file maintains the exact format shown in the examples, with all 20 columns present even if some are left empty.

2. **Batch Processing**: Import in batches of 1,000 or fewer to avoid overwhelming the system.

3. **Backup**: Keep a backup of the original data and your processed files.

4. **Post-Import Verification**: After importing, verify a random sample of entries to ensure they appear correctly in your system.
