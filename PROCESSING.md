# Acronym Processing Workflow

## Processing Settings

### Batch Processing
- Default batch size: 250 acronyms
- Maximum batch size: 250 acronyms
- Processing can be paused between batches
- Progress is tracked and can be resumed

### AI Processing Options
The AI processing tab controls what the AI will do during processing:
- Generate Missing Definitions
- Generate Descriptions
- Suggest Tags
- Use Web Search
- Use Internal Knowledge Base

### Output Display Settings
The output tab controls what information is shown in the results:
- Show Definitions Column
- Show Descriptions Column
- Show Tags Column
- Show Grade Column
- Show Metadata Column

## Processing Logs

### Per-Acronym Logging
For each acronym processed, the system logs:
```
Processing: [ACRONYM]
Definition: [DEFINITION]
Description: [DESCRIPTION]
Tags: [TAGS]
Grade: [GRADE]
```

### Batch Summary
After each batch, a summary is generated:
```
Progress Update
Total Completed: [NUMBER]
Previous batches: [NUMBER] acronyms
This batch: [NUMBER] acronyms ([FIRST] to [LAST])
New total: [NUMBER] acronyms

Next Steps: Starting from '[NEXT]' in the next batch

Notes
Research: Definitions are crafted for Grade 2 relevance, focusing on plausible development-related contexts.
Format: All columns included, with optional fields blank per guidelines.
Batch Size: Processed [NUMBER] acronyms as requested.
```

### Enrichment Summary
When enrichment is performed, a summary is shown:
```
Enrichment Summary
==================
Total acronyms processed: [NUMBER]
Acronyms enriched: [NUMBER]

Enrichment by field:
Definitions added: [NUMBER]
Descriptions added: [NUMBER]
Tags added: [NUMBER]
Grades set: [NUMBER]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Batch Size**
   - Use 250 acronyms per batch for optimal processing
   - Smaller batches allow for more frequent progress checks
   - Larger batches may cause timeouts or memory issues

2. **AI Processing**
   - Enable only the enrichment options you need
   - Web search and internal KB can slow down processing
   - Consider processing in stages (e.g., definitions first, then descriptions)

3. **Output Display**
   - Show only the columns you need to reduce visual clutter
   - Metadata is useful for debugging but can be hidden during normal operation

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Monitor the logs for any errors or warnings
   - Use the batch summaries to track overall progress
   - Save your progress regularly

## Troubleshooting

1. **Processing Errors**
   - Check the logs for specific acronym errors
   - Verify the input data format
   - Ensure all required columns are present

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce batch size if processing is slow
   - Disable unnecessary enrichment options
   - Check system resources (CPU, memory)

3. **Output Issues**
   - Verify output format settings
   - Check for missing or malformed data
   - Ensure all required fields are populated
